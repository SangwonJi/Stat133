### **Ingredients**

##### `Makes 4 Servings`

-   1 ½ cups well-shaken buttermilk
-   4 large eggs
-   3 tablespoons sugar
-   ¼ teaspoon salt
-   12(½-inch-thick) slices challah (from a 1-pound loaf; not end slices)
-   4 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter; divided

#### **Accompaniment**

-   Warm maple syrup

#### **Cooking Steps**

##### **Step 1**

Preheat oven to 200°F.

##### **Step 2**

Whisk together buttermilk, eggs, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Pour into a large 4-sided sheet pan, then add bread in 1 layer and soak, turning occasionally, until bread has absorbed all liquid but is not falling apart, about 20 minutes.

##### **Step 3**

Heat 1½ tablespoon butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until foam subsides. Transfer 4 bread slices with a slotted spatula to skillet and cook, turning once, until slightly puffed and golden brown, about 3 minutes total. Transfer to a large shallow baking pan and keep warm in oven. Cook remaining bread in 2 batches, adding 1½ tablespoon butter between batches.

# **Question 3)Euclidean Distance**

### **Definition** [edit]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the **line segment** connecting them ($\overline{pq}$).

In **Cartesian coordinates**, if **p** = ($p_{1},p_{2},\dots,p_{n}$) and **q** = ($q_{1},q_{2},\dots,q_{n}$) are two points in **Euclidean n-space**, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the **Pythagorean formula**.

$d$(**p**,**q**) = $d$(**q**,**p**) = $\sqrt{(q_{1}-p_{1})^2 + (q_{2}-p_{2})^2+\dots+(q_{n}-p_{n})^2} = \sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_{i}-p_{i})^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a **Euclidean vector**. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector.

$\|p\| = \sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+\dots+p_n^2} = \sqrt{p.p}$,

where the last expression involves the **dot product**.
